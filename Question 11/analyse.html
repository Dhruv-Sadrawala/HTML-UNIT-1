<u>Analyze</u></font>	
<font face="TW Cen MT"size="6"><p>Analysis is the process of breaking a complex topic or substance into smaller<br> parts in order to gain a better understanding of it. The technique has been applied in the study of mathematics and logic since before Aristotle, though analysis as a formal concept is a relatively recent development.
